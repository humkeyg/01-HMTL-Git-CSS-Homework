Description:
  The index.html and style.css files were edited in terms of fixing buttons and rearranging.
    The index.html file with a broken navigation button was fixed.
    The style.css file was spaced out neatly for ease of reading.
    The style.css file was rearranged into a logical order that could be read alongside the html file.
