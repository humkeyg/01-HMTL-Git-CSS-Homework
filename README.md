# 01-HMTL-Git-CSS-Homework

Description
  index.html and style.css files were edited in terms of fixing buttons and rearranging.
    -index.html had a broken navigation button that I fixed
    -style.css was spaced out neatly for ease of reading
    -style.css was rearranged into a logical order that could be read alongside the html file
